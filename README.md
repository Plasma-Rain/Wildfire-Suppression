# Wildfire-Suppression
Plasma Rain is a tactical wildfire suppression concept designed for early ignition control and asset protection. It leverages the interaction between focused microwave bursts and atomized seawater mist to generate short-lived plasma zones that disrupt combustion chemistry.

For a detailed technical description of this concept, see the [WHITE_PAPER.md](WHITE_PAPER.md) document.
